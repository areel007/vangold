        <p class="pl-[10px] text-[14px] md:text-[18px] mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">
          AAC was established as a special purpose vehicle for concession to
          drive the turn-around management, operations, and maintenance of Asaba
          International Airport. The major objective of the concession is to
          foster the remodelling and deployment of requisite airport
          infrastructure with the singular goal of elevating air travel
          experience in the South-East and South-South corridor as well as
          serving as a regional hub for air trac movement connecting West and
          Central Africa.

        <p class="pl-[10px] text-[14px] md:text-[18px] mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">
          Asaba Airport Company is member company of R28 Holdings, a growing
          private investment company created in Nigeria in 2007 and over the
          years secured and consolidated a diversified shareholding portfolio,
          with subsidiaries and investments cutting across a wide range of
          industries and asset classes in Construction, Real Estate Development,
          Oil & Gas, Energy & Infrastructure Services, Aviation, Manufacturing,
          Retail, and basic industry start-ups. R28 currently is involved in

        <p class="pl-[10px] text-[14px] md:text-[18px] mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">

        <p class="pl-[10px] text-[14px] md:text-[18px] mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">
          The consideration for the redevelopment and expansion of Asaba
          International Airport is hinged on the development of a well-planned
          cargo terminal and warehousing facilities to take advantage of the
          commercial and industrial cities of Onitsha and Nnewi on one hand, and
          the oil & gas producing region of the South-south states on the other.
          The certainty is that the passenger and cargo trac will continue to
          soar beyond forecast in line with optimal operations of the airport.
